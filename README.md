# relative-date

This library allows you to enter date formats to return one specific date that matches your criteria. It can be in the past or future.
It can be relative to the current or pivot date or an absolute date.

Relative date references would be eg D-5 is 5 days ago. D1M+5, the 1st day of 5 months from now.
An absolute date reference is D20M10 - the next occurence of 20th of October. D1M7P - The previous 1st of July.

You can go back or forwards in dates.
